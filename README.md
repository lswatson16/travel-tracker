# ðŸ›« Travel Tracker ðŸ›¬

## âœˆ Overview
Travel Tracker has two user interfaces, the traveler and the travel agent. Both users can log in to view their dashboard.

The traveler's dashboard displays all of the traveler's trips and their annual travel expenses. The traveler can view an estimate for a potential trip and request a new trip.

The travel agent dashboard displays new trip requests by travelers. The agent can view their total yearly income and the traveler's on trips for the current year. The travel agent can approve and deny any pending trips; and search for a user by their name in order to:
- View that travelers trips and expenses
- Approve trip request
- Delete upcoming trips.

## âœˆ Instructions

### Get Started
**Client-side server**
  - In the terminal, run the command `git clone` to clone this repo
  - `cd` into the directory `cd travel-tracker`
  - Run `npm install` to download all necessary packages and dependencies
  - Run `npm start` to run the client-side server
    - Go to `http://localhost:8080/`
    - Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

**Back-end server**
  - Create a new directory on your local machine. The new directory should be a separate directory from the front end application.
  - In the new directory, clone down this ***Node.js/Express.js*** [back-end server](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) using command `git clone`
  - Open a new terminal tab and `cd` into the directory `cd travel-tracker-api`
  - Run `npm start` to start up the back-end server
    - You should see a similar message in the terminal:
    ```
    [nodemon] starting node server.js
    Travel Tracker API is now running on http://localhost:3001 ! 
    ```
    - Both servers must be running in order for the application to work as expected.
    - Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

### Build Your Own Travel Tracker
For this project, I used the [Webpack Starter Kit](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/webpack-starter-kit) repo. The setup instructions are in the README. I also cloned down this [back-end server](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) and had it running in a separate tab in my terminal every time I ran my client-side server.

- To log in use ***traveler[:id]*** as the username and ***travel*** as the password. For example, username: ***traveler12*** and password: ***travel***
- A message will alert the user if the incorrect username and password was entered.
