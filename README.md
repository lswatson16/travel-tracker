# ðŸ›« Travel Tracker ðŸ›¬

## âœˆ Overview
Travel Tracker is an application that has two user interfaces, the traveler and the travel agent. Both users can log in to view their dashboard.

The traveler's dashboard displays all of the traveler's trips and their annual travel expenses. The traveler can view an estimate for a potential trip and request a new trip.

The travel agent dashboard displays new trip requests by travelers. The agent can view their total yearly income and the traveler's on trips for the current year. The travel agent can approve and deny any pending trips; and search for a user by their name in order to:
- view that travelers trips and expenses
- approve trip request
- delete upcoming trips.

## âœˆ Instructions/Installations

- Here's the [Deploy Link](https://lswatson16.github.io/travel-tracker/) to interact with the application I built
- For this project, I used the [Webpack Starter Kit](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/webpack-starter-kit) repo. The setup instructions are in the README. I also cloned down this [local server](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) and had it running in a separate tab in my terminal each time I ran my client.
  - Use command `git clone` to clone the repo
  - `cd` into the directory
  - Run `npm install` to download all necessary packages and dependencies
  - Run `npm start` to run the server
    - Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with some `h1` text, Turing logo image and a beautiful gradient background. If that's the case, you're good to go.
    - Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.
