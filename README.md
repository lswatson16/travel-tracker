# ðŸ›« Travel Tracker ðŸ›¬

## âœˆ Overview
Travel Tracker has two user interfaces, the traveler and the travel agent. Both users can log in to view their dashboard.

The traveler's dashboard displays all of the traveler's trips and their annual travel expenses. The traveler can view an estimate for a potential trip and request a new trip.

The travel agent dashboard displays new trip requests by travelers. The agent can view their total yearly income and the traveler's on trips for the current year. The travel agent can approve and deny any pending trips; and search for a user by their name in order to:
- View that travelers trips and expenses
- Approve trip request
- Delete upcoming trips.

I also cloned down this [server](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) and had it running in a separate tab in my terminal each time I ran my client-side server.
